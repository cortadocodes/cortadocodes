### About me
I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Octue](https://octue.com) where I build data and cloud solutions for scientists. My work focuses
on automating various parts of the wind industry (and sometimes other renewable energy tech) and, as a big fan of FOSS, 
I'm happy that the majority is open-source.

### What I've been up to

- Dockerising [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/pull/2121) ([NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/)'s wind farm/turbine simulation software) to aid its deployment as part of a serverless cloud analysis pipeline, making analyses highly parallelisable, automatable, and scalable - all without the need for costly permanent infrastructure     
- Building the [Twined framework](https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python) - an event-driven digital twin / microservices framework for easily running serverless digital twins and data services
  - Powers [WindPioneers](https://www.wind-pioneers.com/)' [WindQuest](https://www.wind-pioneers.com/services/windquest-smarter-tools/) wind farm design software
  - Runs our OpenFAST and TurbSim data services
  - Populates our global Elevations API (see below)
- Improving [WindQuest](https://www.wind-pioneers.com/services/windquest-smarter-tools/)'s staff admin app, delivering a 5x speed-up of daily staff workflows and a significantly more modern UI for staff to use
- Creating a global [Elevations Service](https://github.com/octue/windeurope72hours-elevations-populator), [API](https://github.com/octue/windeurope72hours-elevations-api) and [python client](https://github.com/octue/windeurope72hours-elevations-client-python) that uses the [NASA Copernicus dataset](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) and the [H3 hexagonal hierarchical coordinate system](https://h3geo.org/) to provide the elevation of any coordinate on the planet
- Creating GraphQL APIs for [Strands](https://strands.octue.com/) (our JSON schema version control and publishing system) and some other exciting upcoming apps...
- Working on our [other tools](https://www.octue.com/tools)
