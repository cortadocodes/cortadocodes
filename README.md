### Who am I?
I'm Senior Software Engineer at @Octue where I engineer data and cloud solutions for scientists to help automate the 
wind industry (and sometimes other renewable tech!). Almost all the code I write is open-source and my development 
process is increasingly powered by free and open-source software.

### What I've been up to

- Dockerising [OpenFAST](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/pull/2121) (NREL's wind turbine and wind farm simulation software) to aid its deployment as part of a serverless cloud analysis pipeline, making analyses highly parallelisable, automatable, highly scalable, all without the need for costly permanent infrastructure     
- Building an event-driven [digital twin / microservices framework](https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python) for renewable energy research and engineering
  - Powers @WindPioneers' [WindQuest](https://www.wind-pioneers.com/services/windquest-smarter-tools/) wind farm design software
  - Runs our OpenFAST and TurbSim docker containers serverlessly as data services
  - 
- WindQuest admin upgrade
- Data gateway
- GraphQL API (strands, bezier)
